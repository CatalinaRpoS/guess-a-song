# Guess a Song! 

This is the final project for the Interactive Media course, when you will be able to play with your friends and guess the names of different songs, by listening to the music.

If you want to be heard by the application, press the button located on the top left section of the screen. Press the button again if you don't want to be heard.

Say "para" and "siguiente" to stop and start the music, respectively. If you know the name of the song, say it! The application will continue with the next song; if you fail, you will have more opportunities to win.
